# Deploying ShinobiX on Railway (and other Docker hosts)

This runs the **same Express server** as cPanel (`server.ts` → `dist/server.js`),
serving the API and the React SPA from **one service on one port**. The added
files — `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `railway.json`, `.env.example` — are
additive; `app.js` and the cPanel path are untouched.

Because the image is a plain `Dockerfile`, the exact same setup also deploys to
**Render, Fly.io, or any VPS with Docker** — that's your portability insurance.

---

## How it works

- **One service, same origin.** Express serves the SPA static build *and* the
  `/api/*` routes. The client calls relative `/api/...` paths
  (`shinobij.client/src/authFetch.ts`), so there are **no CORS issues** and no
  build-time API URL to configure.
- **Database path.** When `DATABASE_URL` is set and the app is *not* on Vercel,
  the server uses the direct Postgres pool (`api/_storage.ts:712`) — the same
  code path cPanel uses. Point it at your existing Supabase Postgres.
- **No `app.js`.** The Dockerfile runs `node dist/server.js` directly. The
  DNS/IPv4 hardcoding in `app.js` is cPanel-only and is skipped here.
- **Health check.** `railway.json` points Railway's health check at `/health`
  (defined in `server.ts:204`).

---

## Database — keep Supabase (locked decision)

Railway runs only *compute*; Supabase stays the database (auth, saves, all
durable data) with its managed backups. Connect via `DATABASE_URL`.

1. In Supabase → **Connect → Session pooler**, copy the URI (IPv4 + persistent-
   server friendly; the app strips `sslmode`/`pgbouncer` automatically).
2. Use it as `DATABASE_URL` below. **Leave SSL on** — do NOT set `PG_SSL`
   (Supabase requires TLS).
3. Deploy Railway in the **same region as your Supabase project** to minimise
   round-trip latency on the still-chatty endpoints (until the realtime layer
   removes them).

---

## Deploy via the Railway dashboard (no CLI needed)

1. **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo** → pick this repo/branch.
2. Railway detects `railway.json` and builds with the `Dockerfile` automatically.
3. Open the service → **Variables** → add the env vars from the list below
   (Railway injects `PORT` itself — don't add it).
4. **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain** to get a public
   `*.up.railway.app` URL (or attach a custom domain — see below).
5. Deploy. Watch the build logs; once live, hit `https://<domain>/health` →
   expect `ok`.

## Deploy via the Railway CLI

```bash
npm i -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init                      # or: railway link  (to an existing project)
railway up                        # builds the Dockerfile and deploys
railway variables --set SESSION_SECRET=... --set DATABASE_URL=...   # etc.
railway domain                    # generate a public domain
```

## Environment variables to set

See `.env.example` for the annotated list. Minimum to boot:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | Supabase **Session pooler** URI. Leave SSL on (don't set `PG_SSL`). |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | ✅ | Long random string. Without it, every request pays ~100ms scrypt. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | ✅ | Admin panel. |
| `ADMIN_CONTENT_PASSWORD` | ✅ | Content moderation admin. |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | ✅ (build) | `https://<ref>.supabase.co` — baked into the client at build for Realtime. |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | ✅ (build) | Supabase anon (public) key — build-time, for client Realtime. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | ▲ | Server-side Supabase REST/Storage base (if used). |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | ▲ | Server-side service role — NEVER exposed to the client. |
| `PG_POOL_MAX` | ▲ | Pool size; `15` recommended for the single always-on instance. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | ▲ | Guards the daily snapshot job (set if you use Railway Cron). |
| `RESTART_TOKEN` | ▲ | Guards `POST /restart`. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ○ | Only if the AI image endpoint is used. |

Do **not** set `PORT`, `STATIC_DIR`, `PG_SSL`, `DISK_KV_DIR`, or the `KV_PROXY_*`
vars (see `.env.example` for why).

---

## Daily save-snapshot cron

On Vercel this runs via `vercel.json` (`GET /api/cron/snapshot-saves`, 03:00).
On Railway, add a **Cron** schedule (or a separate cron service) that calls the
endpoint with the secret, e.g.:

```
0 3 * * *   curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://<domain>/api/cron/snapshot-saves
```

(Supabase keeps its own managed backups; this snapshot is an extra safety net.)

---

## Custom domain

If you point `theravensark.com` at Railway, no code change is needed — it's
already in the CORS allowlist (`server.ts:120`, `api/_utils.ts`).

**Only** if you ever serve the client from a *different* origin than the API,
add that origin to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in **both** `server.ts` **and**
`api/_utils.ts` (keep them in sync — see CLAUDE.md).

---

## Migration considerations (read before cutting over)

- **`KV_PROXY_*` overlay.** Off-Railway, the server can route some key prefixes
  to a remote proxy on the cPanel box (`api/_storage.ts:716`, `kv-proxy.ts`).
  If you retire cPanel, that data path disappears. Leave `KV_PROXY_URL` unset on
  Railway so all keys live on the base Postgres — but first confirm nothing
  important currently lives only behind that proxy and migrate it if so.
- **Ephemeral filesystem.** Containers reset their disk on every deploy. Never
  set `DISK_KV_DIR`; keep all state in Postgres (or a Railway Volume if you
  truly need disk).
- **Cross-provider DB traffic.** Railway↔Supabase round trips cost latency +
  egress on both sides, and the 1-second heartbeat write is the worst offender.
  The realtime layer (in-memory presence + WebSocket) removes it — that's the
  actual cost fix. Until then, same-region deployment keeps it tolerable.
- **cPanel/Vercel untouched by these files.** Nothing here changes `app.js`, the
  Passenger setup, or the handlers. Run Railway alongside the old stack during
  cutover, flip DNS when ready, then retire Vercel.

## Local sanity check (optional, needs Docker)

```bash
docker build -t shinobix .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env shinobix
# → open http://localhost:3000  and  http://localhost:3000/health
```
